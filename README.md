This project is made to control my 9x9x9 RGB led cube.

The hardware and software are of my own design. PCBâ€™s are designed with KiCad and the acrylic case is designed with autocad.

The harware includes 18 TLC5940 and a Teensy 3.5 microcontroller. The led cube is multiplexed in layers and data is send to the TLC's using DMA over SPI.

All teensy specific hardware controlling is contained in 1 class OctadecaTLC5940. By modifying this class or making your own base class any microcontroller can be used to run the led cube.
